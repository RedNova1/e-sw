# Beginning

Finally you made your pretty and nice level, It has finally come to see your child in the game.

First click on the spite button on the toolbar and hit `Compile Level` and this window will pop up.

* In the `Level Image` you must place a 4:3 ratio image so that it fits perfectly in the frame (**Note: You can only use .pngs as the level image**).

* In the `Author` you can input your username.

* In the `Level Name` you can input your level's name, Do note that this name also appears on the level end screen too.

Lastly as a small note, if its the first time compiling you have to wait until the project is cached, Afterwards it shouldnt take as long.
