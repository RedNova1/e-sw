# How to update spite

Copypaste the 'DoomahLevelLoader.dll' from your plugin folder in bePinEx to the spite folder in E&S 1.4.0/Assets/Scripts *while the unity project is not open*(note that if you have installed the newest version of Spite the dll already should be there.

# Challenges

* 1. Create an empty gameobject and add to it the 'Challenge Info'

* 2. Add a description for the challenge. Make sure that the text is simple, short and informative. For example: 'Don't fight the Minotaur'.
* 3. Create a new gameobject as a child of the previous one and assign 'SetChallengeStatus' script to it. Then enable 'Active' and disable the gameobject. (Note: if you want the challenge to fail set it to false).

* 4. Assign the challenge gameobject to the object activator.

# Tip of the day

Just assign the script to an empty gameobject and put the tip as whatever you want. Note: tip uses TMP to color the text.
